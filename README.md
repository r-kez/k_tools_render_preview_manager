K-Tools: Render Queue is designed for 3D artists who need to validate ideas quickly. Instead of wasting time setting up and reconfiguring your scene for each animation test or lighting study, manage everything in a unified queue.

- Focus on creation, not output setup.

- Non-Blocking Render Queue: Queue dozens of cameras, sequences, or still frames and let Blender work in the background while you continue modeling or adjusting other files.

- Quick Iteration Profiles: Create dedicated render profiles (e.g., "Low Res Draft," "Client Review," "High Quality"). Switch between quick drafts and clean previews without touching your scene's global settings.

- Smart Overrides for Look-Dev: Need to check the lighting or pure animation? Use profile overrides to instantly force a "Clay Render" (single material) or switch the lighting HDRI for all items in the queue at once. Native Video Export: Forget about external video editors for quick previews. The add-on uses Blender's native encoder to deliver MP4 or MOV files ready to share on Slack, WhatsApp, or frame.io as soon as the render finishes.

- Automatic Organization: Your files are automatically saved in folders organized by sequence, keeping your project directory clean without manual effort.
